## Question File Format

Ensure your `questions.txt` follows this CSV-like format:

```
Question,OptionA,OptionB,OptionC,OptionD,CorrectOption(A/B/C/D),Difficulty(easy/medium/hard)
```

**Example:**
```
What is the capital of India?,Delhi,Mumbai,Chennai,Kolkata,A,easy
```

## How It Works

1. Users **register/login** securely.
2. Choose a **subject** and **difficulty**.
3. Quiz questions are **randomized** and presented one-by-one.
4. A **timer** runs in the background based on difficulty level.
5. On completion, scores are saved and shown with time taken.
6. The **leaderboard** updates dynamically with top performers.

## Leaderboard Logic

The leaderboard displays the **Top 5 performers** based on:
- **Highest Score**
- **Fastest Completion Time (if scores tie)**

Stored in `leaderboard.txt` for easy export and audit.


## Challenges Faced

- Implementing a **non-blocking timer** for each quiz level.
- Designing a **file-driven system** without databases.
- Sorting leaderboard by multiple criteria (**score + time**).
- Building a **clean console interface** with only native Python.

##  Future Enhancements

- Admin panel for adding/editing questions
- Web-based version using Flask/Django
- Detailed quiz analytics for users
- Profile system with historical data
- Email notifications for quiz results
